## Adding Blog Posts

Add a markdown file to `/blog` for it to be added in the blog feed. Make sure your frontmatter contains the entries `title`, `author`, `date`, and `previewImg`.

## Editing Content

Some content is not sourced through Javascript, such as the about page, impressum, FAQ, and team list. For those, you can find their respective markdown and json files in `/content`
